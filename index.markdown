The ExoBrowser is a **scriptable platform** designed to ease the experimentation with new concepts for the Web Browser.

The ExoBrowser exposes its API (parts of the Chromium Content API + a Simple View Model) in Javascript and enables the implementation of a fully functional browser entirely out of it (as a Javascript/HTML/CSS app)

### Hacking with the ExoBrowser

The ExoBrowser comes with a basic shell to showcases its functionalities. You can **dump** the Javascript code of the Shell locally, **modify** it, and **interpret** it back directly with the ExoBrowser executable.

```
- On Mac OS X, the `shell` directory is located under `ExoBrowser.app/Contents/Resources/shell/`.
- On Linux, the `shell` directory comes bundled next to the executable.
```

See the [ExoBrowser JS API Specification](https://github.com/spolu/exo_browser/blob/master/API.md)
